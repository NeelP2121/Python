Hello,
My name is NIKHIL AGARWAL 
.......
AND I DON"T HAVE A GEDIT EDITOR , THEREFORE I AM USING VIM EDITOR.
I HAVE EXPERIENCE IN PROGRAMMING USING NETBEANS(IDE).
I FEEL IDE's ARE MORE USEFUL , BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM TO CODE USING TERMINAL.

THAT's IT FOR TODAY, 
DFTBA!

TIP : TO SEE THE TEXT IN TERMINAL USE CAT !

Q1) DONE THE STEPS.
Q2) a) Interpretation vs Compilation 
Interpreter reads a source file line by line using a program without saving a file ....
by reading i mean it convert the code into machine code ( 0s and 1s )

compiler reads the code and make it into a executable file which is the machine code.

b) Python is a HLL , it have a simpler syntax and uses interpretation technique. it's currently used in 
data science a lot.

C on other hand is between HLL and LLL , syntax are little complex /// it uses complier technique.

Q3) 
1. a = 10 ( integer )
2. b = 4 (integer )
3. c = 3. 4 (float)
4. d=a/10 (float )
5. e = b ∗ c (int , float)
6. a = a ∗ e (int , float)
7. s = "IIITB" (string)
8. t =a+s (error as a and s are different data type )

// tying rule is ,the thing (number or string ) that has to be assign has to be on right of '=' and
variable should be on the left of '=' . //
