Hello,
My name is NIKHIL AGARWAL 
.......
AND I DON"T HAVE A GEDIT EDITOR , THEREFORE I AM USING VIM EDITOR.
I HAVE EXPERIENCE IN PROGRAMMING USING NETBEANS(IDE).
I FEEL IDE's ARE MORE USEFUL , BUT I DONT HAVE ANY PROBLEM TO CODE JUST USING TERMINAL.

THAT's IT FOR TODAY, 
DFTBA 
!!!!!
PRO TIP : :P TO SEE THE TEXT IN TERMINAL USE CAT !
